# Effective-AI-Agents_LangGraph-CrewAI

# Project Overview

This repository contains code, Colab notebooks, and video walkthroughs that demonstrate how to build modular and scalable AI agents using modern frameworks such as LangGraph and CrewAI.

The project showcases several key agent design patterns inspired by the "Building Effective Agents" series by LangChain, adapted and implemented using:

LangGraph — a stateful multi-agent orchestration library built on top of LangChain.

Created stateful graphs of agents with memory and routing logic.
Visualized execution traces and transitions using LangSmith Studio.
Includes ReAct-based reasoning and tool invocation with feedback loops.

CrewAI — a simple, modular framework for creating autonomous agent teams.

Build equivalent flows using Agents, Tasks, and Crew.
Compose logic using modular roles and task prompts.
Run the same pattern for comparative evaluation.
